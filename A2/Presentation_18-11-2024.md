### What does our tool do?
* Finds **relevant** fire/escape stairs in building.
    * Made specifically for tall buildings with escape route in cores
    * Finds staircases in close proximity
* Finds parameters (riser height, treads depth, stair width)
* Checks against BR18, Chapter 5 "Fire Regulations"
* Gives list of accepted and not accepted stairs
* Adds the pset "Fire Stair" on stairs that pass inspection if it is not there already

### Course wishes
* Better understanding of IFCs from the start
    * How to use them practically in code
    * **A real intro** to [IFCOpenshell Documentation](https://docs.ifcopenshell.org/index.html)
* A "forced" way for groups to talk together about script/coding solutions and ideas
    * Also, brainstorming for ideas for script?
