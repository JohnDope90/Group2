## 2B:

We have chosen to work with the report and building from **#2410**. We want to check that the stairs placed in the cores comply with the preaccepted solutions for fire safety regulations, as these are used as escape routes in the building. The claim is found on page 18 in the 2410 report.

### Potential Use Cases  
* [4. Programming](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Uses/Cases/12.html)  
    ##### Description:
    A process in which a spatial program is used to efficiently and accurately **assess design performance in regard to spatial requirements**. The developed BIM model allows the project team to analyze space and understand the complexity of **space standards and regulations**. Critical decisions are made in this phase of design and bring the most value to the project when needs and options are discussed with the client and the best approach is analyzed.

* [12. Code Validation](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Uses/Cases/12.html)  
    ##### Description:
    A process in which code validation software is utilized to **check the model parameters against project specific codes**. Code validation is currently in its infant stage of development within the U.S. and is not in widespread use. However, as model checking tools continue to develop, code compliance software with more codes, code validation should become more prevalent within the design industry.
