We, as analysts, are focusing on the compliance of the stairs with fire safety regulations, particularly ensuring they meet the preaccepted solutions for escape routes in the building

## 2B:

We have chosen to work with the report and building from **#2410**. We want to check that the stairs placed in the cores comply with the preaccepted solutions for fire safety regulations, as these are used as escape routes in the building. The claim is found on page 18 in the 2410 report.

The claims we want to check are:

* **Free Stair Width**: The free width of the staircase must be at least 1.0 m. This ensures that the staircase is wide enough to allow for safe passage.

* **Tread Depth**: The depth of the tread (the part of the stair where you step) must be at least 23-25 cm. This dimension is critical for ensuring that the stair is comfortable and safe to walk on. A tread depth within this range provides sufficient surface area for a secure footing.

* **Riser Height**: The height of the riser (the vertical part between each tread) should not exceed 18 cm. This ensures that the steps are not too steep, making the staircase easier to climb and reducing the risk of tripping.

* **Ceiling Height**: There must be a minimum clearance of 210 cm from the tread to the ceiling above. This ensures that there is enough headroom for people using the stairs.

These claims need to be verified to ensure the staircase meets safety standards ([BR18 - ยง57](https://bygningsreglementet.dk/Tekniske-bestemmelser/02/Krav/57#005499f7-eb23-4ff5-bbaa-16ac6a2bbefe)).

### Potential Use Cases  
* [4. Programming](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Uses/Cases/12.html)  
    ##### Description:
    A process in which a spatial program is used to efficiently and accurately **assess design performance in regard to spatial requirements**. The developed BIM model allows the project team to analyze space and understand the complexity of **space standards and regulations**. Critical decisions are made in this phase of design and bring the most value to the project when needs and options are discussed with the client and the best approach is analyzed.

* [12. Code Validation](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Uses/Cases/12.html)  
    ##### Description:
    A process in which code validation software is utilized to **check the model parameters against project specific codes**. Code validation is currently in its infant stage of development within the U.S. and is not in widespread use. However, as model checking tools continue to develop, code compliance software with more codes, code validation should become more prevalent within the design industry.
